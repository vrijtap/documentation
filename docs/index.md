# VrijTap

Project Vrijtap aims to create a machine that automatically fills your glass with beer. With our machine we are trying to make ordering easy for the customers, keeping track of consumption and storage easy for the owner and wastage low by using sensors / AI.

[A picture of the system will be displayed here when we started working on a prototype]
